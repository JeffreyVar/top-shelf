## <div align="center">  An easy to use application for searching, saving, editing, and creating cocktail recipes! </div>

---

### üóìÔ∏è _Duration: Three-Week-Sprint_

<p> This application was designed for mobile and built to make cocktail-making easy and accessible. </p>
<p> The search feature allows users to find cocktails by name or ingredient(s). If a recipe looks good, it can be saved for future reference. Saved cocktail recipes can also be customized to accommodate specific tastes, or users can make their own recipes completely from scratch. <p>

# Design

Application flowcharting and wireframes  were designed using Figma. A great deal of time and effort was spent to ensure the application flowed logically and that the design was user-friendly and consistent throughout.

## Production Build

Before pushing to Heroku, run `npm run build` in terminal. This will create a build folder that contains the code Heroku will be pointed at. You can test this build by typing `npm start`. Keep in mind that `npm start` will let you preview the production build but will **not** auto update.

- Start postgres if not running already by using `brew services start postgresql`
- Run `npm start`
- Navigate to `localhost:5000`


## Deployment

1. Create a new Heroku project
1. Link the Heroku project to the project GitHub Repo
1. Create an Heroku Postgres database
1. Connect to the Heroku Postgres database from Postico
1. Create the necessary tables
1. Add an environment variable for `SERVER_SESSION_SECRET` with a nice random string for security
1. In the deploy section, select manual deploy
