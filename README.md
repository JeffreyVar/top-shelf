### üóìÔ∏è _Duration: Three-Week-Sprint_

<p> This mobile-first application was built to make cocktail-making easy and accessible. </p>
<p> The search feature allows users to find cocktails by name or ingredient(s). When a user finds a recipe they like, they can save it for future reference. Saved cocktail recipes can also be customized to accommodate a user's specific tastes. Or, users can make their own recipes completely from scratch. <p>

# Design

Application flowcharting and wireframes were designed using Figma. Before ever writing a line of code, several days were spent on scoping TopShelf. Taking the time to parse through the data from the API, set up the database, design routes, and create each wireframe helped ensure that the application flowed logically. The goal was to have a final design that was user-friendly and consistently themed throughout.
