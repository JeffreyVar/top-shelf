## <div align="center">  An easy to use application for searching, saving, editing, and creating cocktail recipes! </div>

---

### üóìÔ∏è _Duration: Three-Week-Sprint_

<p> This mobile-first application was built to make cocktail-making easy and accessible. </p>
<p> The search feature allows users to find cocktails by name or ingredient(s). When a user finds a recipe they like, they can save it for future reference. Saved cocktail recipes can also be customized to accommodate a user's specific tastes. Or, users can make their own recipes completely from scratch. <p>

# Design

Application flowcharting and wireframes were designed using Figma. Before ever writing a line of code, several days were spent on scoping TopShelf. Taking the time to parse through the data from the API, set up the database, design routes, and create each wireframe helped ensure that the application flowed logically. The goal was to have a final design that was user-friendly and consistently themed throughout.

## Production Build

Before pushing to Heroku, run `npm run build` in terminal. This will create a build folder that contains the code Heroku will be pointed at. You can test this build by typing `npm start`. Keep in mind that `npm start` will let you preview the production build but will **not** auto update.

- Start postgres if not running already by using `brew services start postgresql`
- Run `npm start`
- Navigate to `localhost:5000`


## Deployment

1. Create a new Heroku project
1. Link the Heroku project to the project GitHub Repo
1. Create an Heroku Postgres database
1. Connect to the Heroku Postgres database from Postico
1. Create the necessary tables
1. Add an environment variable for `SERVER_SESSION_SECRET` with a nice random string for security
1. In the deploy section, select manual deploy
